Greetings, 

I'm Michael, a Software Engineer from [Heraklion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraklion), Greece. I graduated from the University of Cyprus with a Computer Science degree in 2015 and since then I've been living in [Limassol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limassol), Cyprus, working as a back-end java developer.

I travel abroad a few times a year and pretend to come to profound insights about the human condition. Most days you can find me reading contemporary fiction and writing lame poetry. 

My long term dreams are to *write a book, plant a tree, (develop a video game), have a baby.* I'm happy to report that I'm done with the tree part!

This blog is an avenue to vent my excitement in life. Posts include but are not limited to:

+ Media recommendations: Books, movies, video games, podcasts, music.
+ Programming deep dives: Algorithms, bugs, catastrophic failures and high quality papers.
+ Musings about life: All the insightful analysis you 'd expect from someone on the left side of the *Dunningâ€“Kruger* curve on psychology, history and politics.
+ Commentary on interesting stuff found on the web.

*Thank You for reading!*
