## What to read: [1Q84](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10357575-1q84) by Haruki Murakami

Haruki Murakami's 2009 international best seller probably needs no introduction. After sitting on my wishlist for years, I finally grabbed it and can happily report that the hype is very much deserved in this case. 1Q84 is an expertly written tale about human connections that transforms you to an uncanny world and makes the hours fly by.

## What to listen to: [The butterfly effect](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/audible/the-butterfly-effect-with-jon-ronson) podcast by Jon Ronson

While looking for stuff to listen to on the plane I happened upon this podcost documenting the rise of Pornhub and the various direct and indirect effects it's had since absorbing all the competition and reshaping the industry. Jon Ronson has a unique take on investigative journalism and I've always enjoyed his work. If you enjoy this podcast I'd also recommend his books: [The Psychopath Test](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12391521-the-psychopath-test), [So You've Been Publicly Shamed ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22571552-so-you-ve-been-publicly-shamed).

## What to watch: [The Favorite](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5083738/) by Yorgos Lanthimos

I saw a lot of movies in the municipal open air cinema back home in Heraklion, while I was working from home there this summer. This was the best of them. Smart, quirky, with great performances and customes it is definitely a worthwhile experience

## What to play: [Dicey Dungeons](https://store.steampowered.com/app/861540/Dicey_Dungeons/) by Terry Cavanagh

After [Super Hexagon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/221640/Super_Hexagon/) and [VVVVVV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/70300/VVVVVV/) Terry Cavanagh returns with a third gem. Dicey Dungeons is basically [Slay the Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/) with dice and humor.
