# Read: [Debt: The First 5000 Years](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6617037-debt) 
David Graeber presents a fascinating, well-researched anthropological and historical case for the very nature of debt and money in societies around the world. This counter-narrative rings a lot truer to me than the common myth that gold was invented to make easier the exchange of clothing for chickens.  

I was recently reminded of this book, after listening to [an episode of *The Daily* podcast](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/podcasts/the-daily/haiti-revolt-france-payments.html) of the *NYT* around the *debt* that France imposed on Haiti after it gained it's independance.

# Listen: [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/)

Jack Rhysider hosts a bi-weekly podcast that does deep-dives into technology related crimes and misdemeanors. While these podcasts are a dime a dozen, *Darknet Diaries* actually goes the extra mile in interviewing relevant people and doing appropriate research.  

There are many recent episodes to choose from as a feature, one that comes to mind easily is featuring the story of the investigator who uncovered the scheme behind Puerto Rico's national lottery that was mysteriously losing money.

# Watch: [The Boys](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_boys_2019)
Probably the best produced series currently running.   
*The Boys* is equal parts political satire, drama, dark comedy and character driven epic. It is high paced, violent and unpredictable.  
Everyone gives impressive performances, but Antony Starr as *Homelander*  steals the show.

# Play: [Rogue Legacy 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1253920/Rogue_Legacy_2/)
If you are going to do a sequel, this is how to do it. *Rogue Legacy 2* expands upon the original in almost every way: More areas, bosses, secrets, powers and meta-progression systems.  If you didn't like the original chances are that you will not like the sequel either, but if you never tried *Rogue Legacy* this is a perfect place to jump in.  

*Rogue Legacy 2*, like the original, haves you play as a lineage of characters trying to storm a procedurally generated kingdom. As each character falls, you will choose one of their randomly generated proginy to play next, each with their own moveset and positive/negative/neutral/funky traits and modifiers.  

The game places a heavier emphasis on meta-progression compared to other titles in the genre like [Hollow Knight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/) or [Dead Cells](https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/). That means that *eventually* you should gather enough power to clear the story, even if you are not the most skillful of players. In terms of replayability, there is a very rich NG+ mode, inspired by [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/). Each new NG+ level requires you to include more and more punishing modifiers to enemies and bosses, and some of the game's secrets, challenges and alternate bosses require you to clear many NG+ levels.  

Personally I stopped playing around NG+3 and definitely feel that I got my money's worth out of the experience.
